# Cinema SPA

## Description
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built to manage cinema functions and reservations. It demonstrates modern web development principles using Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), Vite, TailwindCSS, and JSON Server. It includes role-based access control, session persistence, and a dynamic UI.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Vite
* TailwindCSS
* JSON Server
* SweetAlert2

   npm install
   ```
3. Install dependencies for the API (json-server):
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   ```

## Running the project
From the `client` directory, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running json-server

## Role Permissions
**Admin:**
* Can view the movie catalog.
* Can create, edit, and delete movie functions.
* Can view all user reservations.
* Can cancel any reservation.

**User:**
* Can view the movie catalog.
* Can book tickets for active functions.
* Can view only their own reservations.
* Can cancel their own reservations.

## Technical Decisions
* **Architecture:** Modular SPA with centralized routing and service files for API interaction, ensuring separation of concerns.
* **Routing:** Implemented using the History API without page reloads. Includes route guards based on user roles and authentication status.
* **Styling:** TailwindCSS is used for rapid UI development with a responsive and clean design. SweetAlert2 provides elegant modal dialogs and alerts.
* **State Management:** Session is persisted in `localStorage`. The application dynamically reacts to data changes by re-fetching and re-rendering specific DOM sections.
